{title:Description}

{phang}
{opt psplot} generates diagnostic plots available in the twang package of R
     according to the users specifications.
	 
{phang} TWANG is a package of functions in the R Environment for
Statistical Computing and Graphics. The package contains functions
for estimating propensity scores and associated weights using
Generalized Boosting Model and functions for assessing the
covariate balance provided by the resulting weights. {cmd:ps} implements the functions in the R
package by creating an R script file and running it in R batch mode
and then porting the results back to Stata. To use {cmd:ps} a user must have R installed on his or her computer. 

{phang} R is standalone freeware that users can download and install from
The Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.us.r-project.org/).
The software can be installed by clicking on the link for the users
computer platform (e.g., Windows users would click on "Download R
for Windows" and then click on the "base" link to download the
standard R software). Windows users will need to note the directory where the R software is
installed and the name of the executable file. For Windows users
the directory information for the standard installment is "C:\Program Files\R\R-3.0.2\bin\x64"
where 3.0.2 is replaced by the current version of R at the time of
installation. The executable is Rscript.exe for batch implementation.

{phang}
{opth plotname(filename)} specifies the {it:{help filename:filename}}  for the resulting plots. The full path can be given. If not, the plot file is placed in the folder specified by {cmd:objpath}.

{phang}
{opt plots}({it:{help strings:string}}) specifies the type of plot is desired. 

{phang}
The options are:

{synoptset 17}{...}
{p2coldent :Name}Description{p_end}
{synoptline}
{synopt :optimize or 1 }Plot of the balance criteria as a function of the GBM iteration{p_end}
{synopt :boxplot or 2 }Boxplots of the propensity scores for the
              treatment and control cases {p_end}
{synopt :es or 3 }Plots of the standardized effect size of the
              covariates before and after weighing{p_end}
{synopt :t or 4 }Plots of the p-values from t-statistics comparing
              means of treated and control subjects for covariates,
              before and after weighting{p_end}
{synopt :ks or 5 }Plots of the p-values from Kolmogorov-Smirnov
              statistics comparing distributions of covariates
              of treated and control subjects, before and
              after weighting{p_end}
{synopt :histogram or 6 }Histogram of weights for treated and control
              subjects (Currently unavailable){p_end}
{synoptline}

{dlgtab:Required, but optional after ps}

{phang}
{opth rcmd(filename)} specifies the {it:{help filename:filename}} for the R executable. If unspecified, defaults to the same {it:{help filename:filename}} used in {cmd:ps}. Otherwise, defaults to {cmd:Rscript} in Mac OSX and UNIX.

{phang}
{opth inputobj(filename)} specifies the {it:{help filename:filename}}  for the R object produced by
          {cmd:ps} with the propensity score model fitting
          results. If unspecified, defaults to the same {it:{help filename:filename}} used in {cmd:ps}

{phang}
{opt objpath}({it:{help strings:string}}) specifies the folder name for a permanent file of the R object.
		  If unspecified, defaults to the same folder name used in {cmd:ps}  
		  
{dlgtab:Optional}

{phang}
{opt plotformat}({it:{help strings:string}}) specifies the file format for the resulting plots. Typically this
            will match the file extension given in {opt plotname}. If not
            specified by the user it will equal the file extension
            from the {it:{help filename:filename}}  given by {opt plotname}. Valid values
            are {opt jpg}, {opt pdf}, {opt png}, {opt wmf}, and {opt ps}. If an invalid value is specified, the plot will be
            saved as PDF.
            
{phang}
{opth subset(numlist)} restricts the plots to a subset of the stopping
          rules that were employed.  This argument expects a {it:{help numlist:numlist}} of
          the integers from 1 to k, if k {opt stopmethod}'s were used.
	
{phang}
{opt color} specifies if color figures will be produced.
